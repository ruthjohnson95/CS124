# CS 124 PROJECT: Ancestry Mapping

--

## May 5
- possible outputs the estimated number of alleles from each ancestry in each locus for each individual
- cool visualizations of where SNPs map

## May 6
- probably going to get dataset from HapMap; accidently downloaded 8GB file--need to ask which files are actually needed 
- possible baseline method:
	- find SNPs in each invididuals of known populations and label with a certain color
	- look at SNPs of a target individuals and see if any of the SNPs line up with other populations
	- if SNP area overlaps with multiple populations, then take the population that occurs most frequently 
- alternate idea: like 170A project
	- give a bunch of known populations and do neural network traning on them
	- represent each SNP with 1,2,3 (depending on population) and non-snp with 0
